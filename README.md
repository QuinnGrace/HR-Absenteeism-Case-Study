# HR Case Study: Absenteeism Insights and Performance Improvement

NOTE: Due to the nature of this project, code cannot be shared. 

## Context 
The manager of a medium-sized company has noticed a drop in performance from their team. After some investigation, absenteeism is pinpointed as the cause. Further digging must be done to figure out how to prevent this absenteeism.

## Expected Outcomes
- Identify trends in absenteeism
- Identify causes of absenteeism
- Create a dashboard summarising findings
- Present findings to stakeholders

## Tools Used
- PowerBI
- DAX

The dashboard that my team created.

## Conclusions
- Spring had the most absences
- Spring had the highest workload
- 5 employees (of 36) make up half of all absences
- Medical reasons were by far the most common cause of absences
- Drinkers took the most unjustified leave (70%)
- Reason 15 (medical reason) for absenteeism only happened on Mondays and Fridays
- Employees with 4 children took more leave than employees with fewer children
- Obese employees made up only a quarter of employees but a third of all medical leave 

## Recommendations
- Reduce or spread out workload in Spring
- Engage with and provide support to employees with high numbers of absences
- Host events encouraging healthy lifestyles and remodel the office to incentivise healthy choices
- Discourage heavy drinking
- Provide further support to employees with 4 children, such as providing childcare
