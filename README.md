The dashboard that my team created.

## Conclusions
- Spring had the most absences
- July was the month with the most absences
- Spring had the highest workload
- 5 employees (of 36) make up half of all absences
- Medical reasons were by far the most common cause of absences
- Drinkers took the most unjustified leave (70%)
- Reason 15 (medical reason) for absenteeism only happened on Mondays and Fridays
- Employees with 4 children took more leave than employees with fewer children
- Obese employees made up a quarter of employees but a third of all medical leave
